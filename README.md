# rankdaora

rankdaora is a lightweight ranking system prototype built on top of Elasticsearch and FastAPI.
It demonstrates how to enrich search results by combining traditional relevance scores with additional signals — such as user interaction — to produce more “daora” (cool and optimal) rankings.

The project is designed to be simple, modular, and easily extensible, serving as a foundation for experimenting with new ranking strategies, hybrid scoring models, and signal integration.
